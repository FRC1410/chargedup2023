* conditions and unpredictable behavior, tasks can acquire locks. When a task acquires a lock, the
* task with the lowest priority will be suspended. Once the task that claimed possession of a lock
* finishes (whether by cancellation or interruption), execution of the other task that laid claim
* on the lock is rescheduled for execution.
